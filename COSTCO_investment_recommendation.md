**Date:** January 16, 2025

**Executive Summary:**

This report provides an investment recommendation for Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) stock, based on a comprehensive analysis of its financial performance, technical indicators, and market conditions. The recommendation is to **BUY** COST with a specific entry point and price target, while acknowledging the inherent risks and potential for volatility. This recommendation aims to capitalize on Costco's stable growth and market position while managing risk through strategic entry and stop-loss points.

**1. Rationale for Recommendation:**

The recommendation to BUY Costco stock is based on the following factors:

*   **Consistent Financial Performance:** Costco has demonstrated steady revenue growth, increasing from $195.93 billion in 2021 to $254.45 billion in 2024. Profitability has also improved, with net income growing from $5.01 billion to $7.37 billion over the same period.
*   **Stable Profitability:** Gross profit, operating income, and net income have shown steady increases, showcasing the companyâ€™s ability to translate sales into profits.
*   **Healthy Balance Sheet:** Costco's growing asset base, decreasing debt, and increasing equity indicate a strong financial position, although inventory levels have also increased, which should be monitored.
*   **Technical Analysis Support:** The technical analysis identifies a potential support zone around $912-$917, which could serve as an entry point if a reversal pattern or bullish signal is observed.
*   **Strong Market Position:** Costco's membership-based model and strong customer loyalty provide a competitive advantage.

**2. Detailed Analysis:**

**2.1 Financial Analysis:**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Costco's year-over-year revenue growth has been consistent, reflecting a strong market presence and customer loyalty. The growth rate, however, has shown signs of slowing down, suggesting that the company may not continue to grow at the same pace.
*   **Profitability:** The company has shown improvement in gross profit, operating income, and net income, indicating efficient operations. The gross profit margin has remained relatively stable, suggesting consistent pricing and cost management.
*   **Balance Sheet:** The balance sheet reflects a growing asset base, decreasing debt, and increasing equity, indicating a healthy financial position. Inventory levels have increased, which is expected with revenue growth, but should be monitored for potential inefficiencies.
*   **Insider Trading:** The mixed insider trading activity, with both stock awards and sales, suggests a neutral sentiment. The sales by executives could be for personal financial reasons and do not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for the company.

**2.2 Technical Analysis:**

*   **Support and Resistance:** The primary support level is around $902, with a secondary support zone between $912-$917. Resistance levels are at $960, $985, and $1008.
*   **Trend:** The stock has been in a downtrend over the past month, but there is potential for a reversal if the support levels hold.
*   **Volume:** Volume spikes on days with significant price movements, which is normal, but should be monitored for confirmation of any price movements.

**2.3 Risk Assessment:**

*   **Economic Conditions:** Costco's business is sensitive to economic conditions, and a downturn could affect consumer spending and membership renewals.
*   **Competition:** Costco faces competition from other retailers, including online retailers, which could pressure margins and market share.
*   **Supply Chain:** The company is exposed to supply chain risks, which could impact inventory levels and costs.
*   **Membership Model:** Changes in consumer preferences or a decline in the value proposition of the membership model could negatively impact the company.
*   **Down Trend:** The current down trend indicates the potential for price to drop further.

**3. Investment Recommendation:**

**Recommendation:** BUY

**Entry Point:** $920.00

*Rationale:* This entry point is slightly above the identified support zone of $912-$917, and is contingent on confirmation of a bullish signal or reversal pattern. This allows for entry after a slight recovery from the recent lows, with some buffer above the immediate support. The entry point also considers that the price is still in a bearish trend and needs to confirm a reversal.

**Price Target:** $970.00

*Rationale:* This price target is below the resistance level of $985, providing a more conservative upside target. It also allows for potential profit-taking before reaching the major resistance point. This price target is based on the last resistance level observed before the downward trend, and also allows for a reasonable upside.
    * **Upside Potential:** From the entry point of $920.00 to the price target of $970.00, this represents an upside potential of approximately 5.43%.

**Stop-Loss Order:** $900.00

*Rationale:* A stop-loss order set slightly below the primary support level of $902 will help to limit potential losses if the stock price breaks down further.
    * **Risk:** From the entry point of $920.00 to the stop-loss order of $900.00, this represents a risk of approximately 2.17%.

**Timeline for Achieving Price Target:** 2-4 months.

*Rationale:* Based on market conditions and the stock's recent performance, the timeline for achieving the price target is estimated between 2 to 4 months.

**4. Sensitivity Analysis:**

*   **Bullish Scenario:** If Costco's membership renewals and sales remain strong, and there are no significant supply chain disruptions, the stock could break above the $985 resistance level, targeting higher prices.
*   **Bearish Scenario:** If economic conditions worsen, competition intensifies, or supply chain issues persist, the stock could break below the $902 support level, potentially leading to further downside.
*   **Moderate Scenario:** If Costco continues with its current performance, the price will likely fluctuate between the support and resistance levels.
