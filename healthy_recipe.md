### Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
- 500g mushrooms (cremini or button), finely chopped (as a beef alternative)
- 1 cup of dry red wine
- 400g canned tomatoes (crushed or diced)
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon of dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup of unsweetened plant-based milk (e.g., almond, oat, or soy milk)
- 500g tagliatelle pasta (or any pasta of choice) 
- Grated vegan Parmesan cheese, for serving
- Fresh basil leaves, for garnish

### Preparation Instructions:

1. **Sauté Vegetables:**
   - In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are soft and translucent.

2. **Cook the Mushrooms:**
   - Increase the heat to medium-high, add the finely chopped mushrooms to the pan. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon until they release their moisture and brown slightly.

3. **Add Wine:**
   - Pour in the red wine and stir, allowing it to cook down until most of the liquid has evaporated (approximately 5 minutes).

4. **Incorporate Tomatoes:**
   - Mix in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, and dried basil. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.

5. **Simmer the Sauce:**
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, and add a splash of water if it becomes too thick.

6. **Add Plant-Based Milk:**
   - Stir in the plant-based milk and simmer for another 15 minutes. This will add a creamy richness to your vegetarian Bolognese sauce.

7. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - About 15 minutes before serving, cook the tagliatelle (or chosen pasta) according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water. Drain when al dente, saving a cup of pasta water.

8. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**
   - Toss the drained pasta with the Bolognese sauce, adding reserved pasta water if needed to help coat the pasta.

### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve the vegetarian Bolognese on warm plates, topped with grated vegan Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves for garnish.
- Pair with a side of garlic bread and a simple green salad to balance the richness of the dish.
- For an Italian dining experience, serve with a glass of red wine.

### Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:
- **Ground Beef and Ground Pork** have been replaced with **Mushrooms**. Mushrooms offer a meaty texture and umami flavor that closely mimics the richness of traditional meat sauces, making them an excellent substitute.
- **Whole Milk** has been replaced with **Plant-Based Milk**, which offers a creamy consistency while keeping the dish dairy-free and suitable for vegetarians.
- **Parmesan Cheese** has been substituted with **Vegan Parmesan Cheese**, providing similar nuttiness and flavor without using animal products.
