But we will incorporate the latest research whenever possible. Randy has just completed his annual survey of data, analytics, and AI executives, the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey , conducted by his educational firm, Data & AI Leadership Exchange; and Tom has worked on several surveys on generative AI and data, technology leadership structures, and, most recently, agentic AI.\n",

      "1. Leaders will grapple with both the promise and hype around agentic AI.\n",
      "Let’s get agentic AI — the kind of AI that does tasks independently — out of the way first: It’s a sure bet for 2025’s “most trending AI trend.” Agentic AI seems to be on an inevitable rise: Everybody in the tech vendor and analyst worlds is excited about the prospect of having AI programs collaborate to do real work instead of just generating content, even though nobody is entirely sure how it will all work. Some IT leaders think they already have it (37%, in a forthcoming UiPath-sponsored survey of 252 U.S. IT leaders); most expect it soon and are ready to spend money on it (68% within six months or less); and a few skeptics (primarily encountered by us in interviews) think it’s mostly vendor hype.\n",
      "Most technology executives believe that these autonomous and collaborative AI programs will be primarily based on focused generative AI bots that will perform specific tasks. Most people believe that there will be a network of these agents, and many are hoping that the agent ecosystems will need less human intervention than AI has required in the past. Some believe that the technology will all be orchestrated by robotic process automation tools; some propose that agents will be fetched by enterprise transaction systems; and some posit the emergence of an “uber agent” that will control everything.\n",
      "The earliest agentic AI tools will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved.\n",
      "Here’s what we think: There will be (and in some cases, already are) generative AI bots that will do people’s bidding on specific content creation tasks. It will require more than one of these agentic AI tools to do something significant, such as make a travel reservation or conduct a banking transaction. But these systems still work by predicting the next word, and sometimes that will lead to errors or inaccuracies. So there will still be a need for humans to check in on them every now and then.\n",
      "The earliest agents will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved — for instance, helping change your password on the IT side, or reserving time off for vacations in HR systems. We don’t see much likelihood of companies turning these agents loose on real customers spending real money anytime soon, unless there’s the opportunity for human review or the reversal of a transaction. As a result, we don’t foresee a major impact on the human workforce from this technology in 2025, except for new jobs writing blog posts about agentic AI. (Wait, can agents do that?)\n",
      "2. The time has come to measure results from generative AI experiments.\n",
      "One of the reasons why everybody is excited about agents is that as of 2024, it has still proved difficult to demonstrate economic value from generative AI. We argued in last year’s AI trends article that the value of GenAI still needed to be demonstrated. Data and AI leaders in Randy’s 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey said they are confident that GenAI value is being generated: Fifty-eight percent said that their organization has achieved exponential productivity or efficiency gains from AI, presumably mostly from generative AI. Another 16% said that they have “liberated knowledge workers from mundane tasks” through the use of GenAI tools. Let’s hope that these highly positive beliefs are correct.\n",
      "But companies shouldn’t take such confidence on faith. Very few companies are actually measuring productivity gains carefully or figuring out what the liberated knowledge workers are doing with their freed-up time. Only a few academic studies have measured GenAI productivity gains, and when they have, they’ve generally found some improvements, but not exponential ones. Goldman Sachs is one of the rare companies that has measured productivity gains in the area of programming . Developers there reported that their productivity increased by about 20%. Most similar studies have found contingent factors in productivity, where either inexperienced workers gain more (as in customer service and consulting) or experienced workers do better (as in code generation).\n",
      "In many cases, the best way to measure productivity gains will be to establish controlled experiments. For example, a company could have one group of marketers use generative AI to create content without human review, one use it with human review, and a control group not use it at all. Again, few companies are doing this, and this will need to change. Given that GenAI is primarily about content generation for many companies right now, if we want to really understand the benefits, we’ll also have to start measuring content quality. That’s notoriously difficult to do with knowledge work output. However, if GenAI helps write blog posts much faster but the posts are boring and inaccurate, that’s important to measure: There will be little benefit in that particular use case.\n",
      "The sad fact is that if many organizations are actually to achieve exponential productivity gains, those improvements may be measured in large-scale layoffs. But there is no sign of mass layoffs in the employment statistics. Additionally, a Nobel Prize winner in economics this year, MIT’s Daron Acemoglu , has commented that we haven’t seen real productivity gains from AI thus far, and he doesn’t expect to see anything dramatic over the next several years — perhaps a 0.5% increase over the next decade. In any case, if companies are really going to see and profit from GenAI, they’re going to need to measure and experiment to see the benefits.\n",
      "3. Reality about data-driven culture sets in.\n",
      "We seem to be realizing that generative AI is very cool but doesn’t change everything, specifically long-term cultural attributes. In our trend article last year, we noted that Randy’s survey found that the percentage of company respondents who said that their organization had “created a data and AI-driven organization” and “established a data and AI-driven organizational culture” both doubled over the prior year (from 24% to 48% for creating data- and AI-driven organizations, and from 21% to 43% for establishing data-driven cultures). We were both somewhat astonished at this dramatic reported improvement, and we attributed the changes to generative AI, since it was very widely publicized and adopted rapidly by organizations.\n",
      "Our long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven.\n",
      "This year, the numbers have settled back to Earth a bit. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said they work in a data- and AI-driven organization, and 33% said they have a data- and AI-driven culture. It’s still a good thing that data and AI leaders feel that their organizations have improved in this regard over the distant past, but our long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven.\n",
      "In the same survey, 92% of the respondents said they feel that cultural and change management challenges are the primary barrier to becoming data- and AI-driven. This suggests that any technology alone is insufficient. It’s worth noting that most of the surveyed employees were from legacy organizations that were founded over a generation ago and have a history of transforming gradually. Many of these companies did more to execute on their digital strategies during the pandemic than they had in the previous two decades.\n",
      "4. Unstructured data is important again.\n",
      "Generative AI has had another impact on organizations: It’s making unstructured data important again. In the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey, 94% of data and AI leaders said that interest in AI is leading to a greater focus on data. Since traditional analytical AI has been around for several decades, we think they were referring to GenAI’s impact. In another survey that we mentioned in last year’s AI trends article, there was substantial evidence that most companies hadn’t yet started to really manage data to get ready for generative AI.\n",
      "The great majority of the data that GenAI works with is relatively unstructured, in forms such as text, images, video, and the like. A leader at one large insurance organization recently shared with Randy that 97% of the company’s data was unstructured. Many companies are interested in using GenAI to help manage and provide access to their own data and documents, typically using an approach called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. But some companies haven’t worked on their unstructured data much since the days of knowledge management 20 or more years ago. They’ve been focused on structured data — typically rows and columns of numbers from transactional systems.\n",
      "To get unstructured data into shape, organizations need to pick the best examples of each document type, tag or graph the content, and get it loaded into the system. (Welcome to the arcane world of embeddings, vector databases, and similarity search algorithms.) These approaches do provide considerable knowledge-access benefits for employees, which is why many organizations are pursuing them. But this work is still human-intensive. At some point, perhaps, we’ll be able to just load tons of our internal documents into a GenAI prompt window, but 2025 is unlikely to be that time. Even when that’s possible, there will still be a need for considerable human curation of the data — because ChatGPT can’t tell which is the best of 20 different sales proposals.\n",

      "5. Who should run data and AI? Expect continued struggle.\n",
      "It should perhaps come as no surprise that while data and attempts to exploit it with AI are receiving increasing amounts of organizational attention and investment, the data leadership function itself is continuing to struggle. The role is still relatively nascent — just 12% of organizations in Randy’s first annual executive survey back in 2012 had appointed a chief data officer. Progress is being made: Eighty-five percent of organizations in Randy’s newest survey have named a chief data officer, and increasing percentages of those data leaders are primarily focused on growth, innovation, and transformation (as opposed to avoiding risk or regulatory problems). More organizations have also named chief AI officers — a surprising 33%.\n",
      "While these roles continue to evolve, organizations continue to wrestle with their mandates, responsibilities, and reporting structures. Fewer than half of data leaders (mostly chief data officers) who responded to Randy’s AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey said their function is very successful and well established, and only 51% said they feel that the job is well understood within their organizations. We are still not sure that the responsibilities of a chief AI officer and a chief data (and analytics/AI) officer demand separate roles, though some organizations, including Capital One and Cleveland Clinic, have established the chief AI officer role as a peer to the chief data officer.\n",
      "The one thing that we can say with confidence is that the demand for data and AI leadership will only grow, under whatever shape, form, and structure this demand entails.\n",
      "We’re of two minds about the broader future of the chief data and AI officer . Randy firmly believes that the role of CDAO should be a business role reporting into business leadership. He notes that 36% of data and AI leaders in his survey this year reported to either the CEO, president, or COO. Randy strongly believes that data and AI leaders need to deliver measurable business value, and to understand and speak the language of the business.\n",
      "Tom agrees that tech leaders need to be more focused on business value. But as we argued in last year’s trend report, he feels that there are too many “tech chiefs,” including CDAOs, in most organizations. Many of those CDAOs themselves feel that their internal customers are confused by all of the C-level tech executives and that the proliferation of such roles makes it both difficult to collaborate and unlikely that they will report to the CEO. Tom would prefer to see “supertech leaders,” with all of the tech roles reporting to them, as is the case in a growing number of companies that have promoted transformation-minded CIOs to fill the role. Whatever the right answer is, it’s clear that organizations must make some interventions and make those who lead data as respected as the data itself.\n",

      "Generative AI is at a crossroads. It's now more than two years since ChatGPT's launch, and the initial optimism about AI's potential is decidedly tempered by an awareness of its limitations and costs.\n",
      "The 2025 AI landscape reflects that complexity. While excitement still abounds -- particularly for emerging areas, like agentic AI and multimodal models -- it's also poised to be a year of growing pains.\n",
      "Companies are increasingly looking for proven results from generative AI , rather than early-stage prototypes. That's no easy feat for a technology that's often expensive, error-prone and vulnerable to misuse. And regulators will need to balance innovation and safety, while keeping up with a fast-moving tech environment.\n",
      "Here are eight of the top AI trends to prepare for in 2025.\n",
      "1. Hype gives way to more pragmatic approaches\n",
      "Since 2022, there's been an explosion of interest and innovation in generative AI, but actual adoption remains inconsistent. Companies often struggle to move generative AI projects, whether internal productivity tools or customer-facing applications, from pilot to production.\n",
      "This article is part of\n",
      "What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses\n",
      "Which also includes:\n",
      "How can AI drive revenue? Here are 10 approaches\n",
      "8 jobs that AI can't replace and why\n",
      "8 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2025\n",
      "Although many businesses have explored generative AI through proofs of concept, fewer have fully integrated it into their operations. In a September 2024 research report , Informa TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found that, although over 90% of organizations had increased their generative AI use over the previous year, only 8% considered their initiatives mature.\n",
      "\"The most surprising thing for me [in 2024] is actually the lack of adoption that we're seeing,\" said Jen Stave, launch director for the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard University. \"When you look across businesses, companies are investing in AI. They're building their own custom tools. They're buying off-the-shelf enterprise versions of the large language models (LLMs). But there really hasn't been this groundswell of adoption within companies.\"\n",
      "One reason for this is AI's uneven impact across roles and job functions. Organizations are discovering what Stave termed the \"jagged technological frontier,\" where AI enhances productivity for some tasks or employees, while diminishing it for others. A junior analyst, for example, might significantly increase their output by using a tool that only bogs down a more experienced counterpart.\n",
      "\"Managers don't know where that line is, and employees don't know where that line is,\" Stave said. \"So, there's a lot of uncertainty and experimentation.\"\n",
      "Despite the sky-high levels of generative AI hype, the reality of slow adoption is hardly a surprise to anyone with experience in enterprise tech. In 2025, expect businesses to push harder for measurable outcomes from generative AI: reduced costs, demonstrable ROI and efficiency gains.\n",
      "2. Generative AI moves beyond chatbots\n",
      "When most laypeople hear the term generative AI , they think of tools like ChatGPT and Claude powered by LLMs. Early explorations from businesses, too, have tended to involve incorporating LLMs into products and services via chat interfaces. But, as the technology matures, AI developers, end users and business customers alike are looking beyond chatbots.\n",
      "\"People need to think more creatively about how to use these base tools and not just try to plop a chat window into everything,\" said Eric Sydell, founder and CEO of Vero AI, an AI and analytics platform.\n",
      "This transition aligns with a broader trend: building software atop LLMs rather than deploying chatbots as standalone tools. Moving from chatbot interfaces to applications that use LLMs on the back end to summarize or parse unstructured data can help mitigate some of the issues that make generative AI difficult to scale.\n",
      "\"[A chatbot] can help an individual be more effective ... but it's very one on one,\" Sydell said. \"So, how do you scale that in an enterprise-grade way?\"\n",
      "Heading into 2025, some areas of AI development are starting to move away from text-based interfaces entirely. Increasingly, the future of AI looks to center around multimodal models, like OpenAI's text-to-video Sora and ElevenLabs' AI voice generator, which can handle nontext data types, such as audio, video and images.\n",
      "\"AI has become synonymous with large language models, but that's just one type of AI,\" Stave said. \"It's this multimodal approach to AI [where] we're going to start seeing some major technological advancements.\"\n",
      "Robotics is another avenue for developing AI that goes beyond textual conversations -- in this case, to interact with the physical world. Stave anticipates that foundation models for robotics could be even more transformative than the arrival of generative AI.\n",
      "\"Think about all of the different ways we interact with the physical world,\" she said. \"I mean, the applications are just infinite.\"\n",
      "3. AI agents are the next frontier\n",
      "The second half of 2024 has seen growing interest in agentic AI models capable of independent action. Tools like Salesforce's Agentforce are designed to autonomously handle tasks for business users, managing workflows and taking care of routine actions, like scheduling and data analysis.\n",
      "Agentic AI is in its early stages. Human direction and oversight remain critical, and the scope of actions that can be taken is usually narrowly defined. But, even with those limitations, AI agents are attractive for a wide range of sectors.\n",
      "Autonomous functionality isn't totally new, of course; by now, it's a well-established cornerstone of enterprise software. The difference with AI agents lies in their adaptability: Unlike simple automation software, agents can adapt to new information in real time, respond to unexpected obstacles and make independent decisions.\n",
      "Yet, that same independence also entails new risks. Grace Yee, senior director of ethical innovation at Adobe, warned of \"the harm that can come ... as agents can start, in some cases, acting upon your behalf to help with scheduling or do other tasks.\" Generative AI tools are notoriously prone to hallucinations, or generating false information -- what happens if an autonomous agent makes similar mistakes with immediate, real-world consequences?\n",
      "Sydell cited similar concerns, noting that some use cases will raise more ethical issues than others. \"When you start to get into high-risk applications -- things that have the potential to harm or help individuals -- the standards have to be way higher,\" he said.\n",
      "Compared with generative AI, agentic AI offers greater autonomy and adaptability.\n",
      "4. Generative AI models become commodities\n",
      "The generative AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with foundation models seemingly now a dime a dozen. As 2025 begins, the competitive edge is moving away from which company has the best model to which businesses excel at fine-tuning pretrained models or developing specialized tools to layer on top of them.\n",
      "In a recent newsletter , analyst Benedict Evans compared the boom in generative AI models to the PC industry of the late 1980s and 1990s. In that era, performance comparisons focused on incremental improvements in specs like CPU speed or memory, similar to how today's generative AI models are evaluated on niche technical benchmarks.\n",
      "Over time, however, these distinctions faded as the market reached a good-enough baseline, with differentiation shifting to factors such as cost, UX and ease of integration. Foundation models seem to be on a similar trajectory: As performance converges, advanced models are becoming more or less interchangeable for many use cases.\n",
      "In a commoditized model landscape, the focus is no longer number of parameters or slightly better performance on a certain benchmark, but instead usability, trust and interoperability with legacy systems. In that environment, AI companies with established ecosystems, user-friendly tools and competitive pricing are likely to take the lead.\n",
      "5. AI applications and data sets become more domain-specific\n",
      "Leading AI labs, like OpenAI and Anthropic, claim to be pursuing the ambitious goal of creating artificial general intelligence ( AGI ), commonly defined as AI that can perform any task a human can. But AGI -- or even the comparatively limited capabilities of today's foundation models -- is far from necessary for most business applications.\n",
      "For enterprises, interest in narrow, highly customized models started almost as soon as the generative AI hype cycle began. A narrowly tailored business application simply doesn't require the degree of versatility necessary for a consumer-facing chatbot.\n",
      "\"There's a lot of focus on the general-purpose AI models,\" Yee said. \"But I think what is more important is really thinking through: How are we using that technology ... and is that use case a high-risk use case?\"\n",
      "In short, businesses should consider more than what technology is being deployed and instead think more deeply about who will ultimately be using it and how. \"Who's the audience?\" Yee said. \"What's the intended use case? What's the domain it's being used in?\"\n",
      "Although, historically, larger data sets have driven model performance improvements, researchers and practitioners are debating whether this trend can hold. Some have suggested that, for certain tasks and populations, model performance plateaus -- or even worsens -- as algorithms are fed more data.\n",
      "\"The motivation for scraping ever-larger data sets may be based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about model performance,\" authors Fernando Diaz and Michael Madaio wrote in their paper \"Scaling Laws Do Not Scale.\" \"That is, models may not, in fact, continue to improve as the data sets get larger -- at least not for all people or communities impacted by those models.\"\n",
      "6. AI literacy becomes essential\n",
      "Generative AI's ubiquity has made AI literacy an in-demand skill for everyone from executives to developers to everyday employees. That means knowing how to use these tools, assess their outputs and -- perhaps most importantly -- navigate their limitations.\n",
      "Notably, although AI and machine learning talent remains in demand, developing AI literacy doesn't need to mean learning to code or train models. \"You don't necessarily have to be an AI engineer to understand these tools and how to use them and whether to use them,\" Sydell said. \"Experimenting, exploring, using the tools is massively helpful.\"\n",
      "Amid the persistent generative AI hype, it can be easy to forget that the technology is still relatively new. Many people either haven't used it at all or don't use it regularly: A recent research paper found that, as of August 2024, less than half of Americans aged 18 to 64 use generative AI, and just over a quarter use it at work.\n",
      "That's a faster pace of adoption compared with the PC or the internet, as the paper's authors pointed out, but it's still not a majority. There's also a gap between businesses' official stances on generative AI and how real workers are using it in their day-to-day tasks.\n",
      "\"If you look at how many companies say they're using it, it's actually a pretty low share who are formally incorporating it into their operations,\" David Deming, professor at Harvard University and one of the paper's authors, told The Harvard Gazette. \"People are using it informally for a lot of different purposes, to help write emails, using it to look up things, using it to obtain documentation on how to do something.\"\n",
      "Stave sees a role for both companies and educational institutions in closing the AI skills gap. \"When you look at companies, they understand the on-the-job training that workers need,\" she said. \"They always have because that's where the work takes place.\"\n",
      "Universities, in contrast, are increasingly offering skill-based, rather than role-based, education that's available on an ongoing basis and applicable across multiple jobs. \"The business landscape is changing so fast. You can't just quit and go back and get a master's and learn everything new,\" Stave said. \"We have to figure out how to modularize the learning and get it out to people in real time.\"\n",
      "7. Businesses adjust to an evolving regulatory environment\n",
      "As 2024 progressed, companies were faced with a fragmented and rapidly changing regulatory landscape . Whereas the EU set new compliance standards with the passage of the AI Act in 2024, the U.S. remains comparatively unregulated -- a trend likely to continue in 2025 under the Trump administration.\n",
      "\"One thing that I think is pretty inadequate right now is legislation [and] regulation around these tools,\" Sydell said. \"It seems like that's not going to happen anytime soon at this point.\" Stave likewise said she's \"not expecting significant regulation from the new administration.\"\n",
      "That light-touch approach could promote AI development and innovation, but the lack of accountability also raises concerns about safety and fairness. Yee sees a need for regulation that protects the integrity of online speech, such as giving users access to provenance information about internet content , as well as anti-impersonation laws to protect creators.\n",
      "To minimize harm without stifling innovation, Yee said she'd like to see regulation that can be responsive to the risk level of a specific AI application. Under a tiered risk framework, she said, \"low-risk AI applications can go to market faster, [while] high-risk AI applications go through a more diligent process.\"\n",
      "Stave also pointed out that minimal oversight in the U.S. doesn't necessarily mean that companies will operate in a fully unregulated environment. In the absence of a cohesive global standard, large incumbents operating in multiple regions typically end up adhering to the most stringent regulations by default. In this way, the EU's AI Act could end up functioning similarly to GDPR , setting de facto standards for companies building or deploying AI worldwide.\n",
      "8. AI-related security concerns escalate\n",
      "The widespread availability of generative AI, often at low or no cost, gives threat actors unprecedented access to tools for facilitating cyberattacks. That risk is poised to increase in 2025 as multimodal models become more sophisticated and readily accessible.\n",
      "In a recent public warning , the FBI described several ways cybercriminals are using generative AI for phishing scams and financial fraud. For example, an attacker targeting victims via a deceptive social media profile might write convincing bio text and direct messages with an LLM, while using AI-generated fake photos to lend credibility to the false identity.\n",
      "AI video and audio pose a growing threat, too. Historically, models have been limited by telltale signs of inauthenticity, like robotic-sounding voices or lagging, glitchy video. While today's versions aren't perfect, they're significantly better, especially if an anxious or time-pressured victim isn't looking or listening too closely.\n",
      "Audio generators can enable hackers to impersonate a victim's trusted contacts, such as a spouse or colleague. Video generation has so far been less common, as it's more expensive and offers more opportunities for error. But, in a highly publicized incident earlier this year, scammers successfully impersonated a company's CFO and other staff members on a video call using deepfakes, leading a finance worker to send $25 million to fraudulent accounts.\n",
      "Other security risks are tied to vulnerabilities within models themselves, rather than social engineering. Adversarial machine learning and data poisoning , where inputs and training data are intentionally designed to mislead or corrupt models, can damage AI systems themselves. To account for these risks, businesses will need to treat AI security as a core part of their overall cybersecurity strategies.\n",

Here are five other hot trends you should watch out for this year.\n",
      "By James O'Donnell archive page Will Douglas Heaven archive page Melissa Heikkilä archive page January 8, 2025 Stephanie Arnett/MIT Technology Review | Lummi MIT Technology Review ’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them  here . For the last couple of years we’ve had a go at predicting what’s coming next in AI. A fool’s game given how fast this industry moves. But we’re on a roll , and we’re doing it again. How did we score last time round? Our four hot trends to watch out for in 2024 included what we called customized chatbots—interactive helper apps powered by multimodal large language models (check: we didn’t know it yet, but we were talking about what everyone now calls agents , the hottest thing in AI right now); generative video (check: few technologies have improved so fast in the last 12 months , with OpenAI and Google DeepMind releasing their flagship video generation models, Sora and Veo, within a week of each other this December); and more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks (check: the payoffs from large language models continue to trickle down to other parts of the tech industry , and robotics is top of the list ).  We also said that AI-generated election disinformation would be everywhere, but here—happily—we got it wrong. There were many things to wring our hands over this year, but political deepfakes were thin on the ground .\n",
      "So what’s coming in 2025? We’re going to ignore the obvious here: You can bet that agents and smaller, more efficient, language models will continue to shape the industry. Instead, here are five alternative picks from our AI team. 1. Generative virtual playgrounds  If 2023 was the year of generative images and 2024 was the year of generative video —what comes next? If you guessed generative virtual worlds (a.k.a. video games), high fives all round.\n",
      "We got a tiny glimpse of this technology in February, when Google DeepMind revealed a generative model called Genie that could take a still image and turn it into a side-scrolling 2D platform game that players could interact with. In December, the firm revealed Genie 2 , a model that can spin a starter image into an entire virtual world. Other companies are building similar tech. In October, the AI startups Decart and Etched revealed an unofficial Minecraft hack in which every frame of the game gets generated on the fly as you play . And World Labs, a startup cofounded by Fei-Fei Li—creator of ImageNet, the vast data set of photos that kick-started the deep-learning boom—is building what it calls large world models, or LWMs. One obvious application is video games. There’s a playful tone to these early experiments, and generative 3D simulations could be used to explore design concepts for new games, turning a sketch into a playable environment on the fly. This could lead to entirely new types of games .  But they could also be used to train robots. World Labs wants to develop so-called spatial intelligence—the ability for machines to interpret and interact with the everyday world. But robotics researchers lack good data about real-world scenarios with which to train such technology. Spinning up countless virtual worlds and dropping virtual robots into them to learn by trial and error could help make up for that.    — Will Douglas Heaven 2. Large language models that “reason” The buzz was justified. When OpenAI revealed o1 in September, it introduced a new paradigm in how large language models work. Two months later, the firm pushed that paradigm forward in almost every way with o3—a model that just might reshape this technology for good. Most models, including OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4, spit out the first response they come up with. Sometimes it’s correct; sometimes it’s not . But the firm's new models are trained to work through their answers step by step, breaking down tricky problems into a series of simpler ones. When one approach isn’t working, they try another. This technique, known as “reasoning” (yes— we know exactly how loaded that term is ), can make this technology more accurate, especially for math, physics, and logic problems. Related Story What are AI agents?  The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Here’s how they will work.\n",
      "It’s also crucial for agents. In December, Google DeepMind revealed an experimental new web-browsing agent called Mariner. In the middle of a preview demo that the company gave to MIT Technology Review , Mariner seemed to get stuck. Megha Goel, a product manager at the company, had asked the agent to find her a recipe for Christmas cookies that looked like the ones in a photo she’d given it. Mariner found a recipe on the web and started adding the ingredients to Goel’s online grocery basket. Then it stalled; it couldn’t figure out what type of flour to pick. Goel watched as Mariner explained its steps in a chat window: “It says, ‘I will use the browser’s Back button to return to the recipe.’”\n",
      "It was a remarkable moment. Instead of hitting a wall, the agent had broken the task down into separate actions and picked one that might resolve the problem. Figuring out you need to click the Back button may sound basic, but for a mindless bot it’s akin to rocket science. And it worked: Mariner went back to the recipe, confirmed the type of flour, and carried on filling Goel’s basket. Google DeepMind is also building an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 , its latest large language model, that uses this step-by-step approach to problem solving, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking . But OpenAI and Google are just the tip of the iceberg. Many companies are building large language models that use similar techniques, making them better at a whole range of tasks, from cooking to coding. Expect a lot more buzz about reasoning ( we know, we know ) this year. —Will Douglas Heaven 3. It’s boom time for AI in science  One of the most exciting uses for AI is speeding up discovery in the natural sciences. Perhaps the greatest vindication of AI’s potential on this front came last October, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper from Google DeepMind for building the AlphaFold tool, which can solve protein folding, and to David Baker for building tools to help design new proteins. Expect this trend to continue next year, and to see more data sets and models that are aimed specifically at scientific discovery. Proteins were the perfect target for AI, because the field had excellent existing data sets that AI models could be trained on.  The hunt is on to find the next big thing. One potential area is materials science. Meta has released massive data sets and models that could help scientists use AI to discover new materials much faster, and in December, Hugging Face, together with the startup Entalpic, launched LeMaterial , an open-source project that aims to simplify and accelerate materials research. Their first project is a data set that unifies, cleans, and standardizes the most prominent material data sets.  AI model makers are also keen to pitch their generative products as research tools for scientists. OpenAI let scientists test its latest o1 model and see how it might support them in research. The results were encouraging.   Having an AI tool that can operate in a similar way to a scientist is one of the fantasies of the tech sector. In a manifesto published in October last year, Anthropic founder Dario Amodei highlighted science, especially biology, as one of the key areas where powerful AI could help. Amodei speculates that in the future, AI could be not only a method of data analysis but a “virtual biologist who performs all the tasks biologists do.” We’re still a long way away from this scenario. But next year, we might see important steps toward it.  —Melissa Heikkilä 4. AI companies get cozier with national security There is a lot of money to be made by AI companies willing to lend their tools to border surveillance, intelligence gathering, and other national security tasks.  The US military has launched a number of initiatives that show it’s eager to adopt AI, from the Replicator program—which, inspired by the war in Ukraine, promises to spend $1 billion on small drones—to the Artificial Intelligence Rapid Capabilities Cell, a unit bringing AI into everything from battlefield decision-making to logistics. European militaries are under pressure to up their tech investment, triggered by concerns that Donald Trump’s administration will cut spending to Ukraine. Rising tensions between Taiwan and China weigh heavily on the minds of military planners, too.\n",
      "Related Story What’s next for our privacy? The US still has no federal privacy law. But recent enforcement actions against data brokers may offer some new protections for Americans’ personal information.\n",
      "In 2025, these trends will continue to be a boon for defense-tech companies like Palantir, Anduril, and others, which are now capitalizing on classified military data to train AI models.  The defense industry’s deep pockets will tempt mainstream AI companies into the fold too. OpenAI in December announced it is partnering with Anduril on a program to take down drones, completing a year-long pivot away from its policy of not working with the military. It joins the ranks of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, which have worked with the Pentagon for years.\n",
      "Other AI competitors, which are spending billions to train and develop new models, will face more pressure in 2025 to think seriously about revenue. It’s possible that they’ll find enough non-defense customers who will pay handsomely for AI agents that can handle complex tasks, or creative industries willing to spend on image and video generators.  But they’ll also be increasingly tempted to throw their hats in the ring for lucrative Pentagon contracts. Expect to see companies wrestle with whether working on defense projects will be seen as a contradiction to their values. OpenAI’s rationale for changing its stance was that “democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development,” the company wrote , reasoning that lending its models to the military would advance that goal. In 2025, we’ll be watching others follow its lead.  — James O’Donnell 5. Nvidia sees legitimate competition For much of the current AI boom, if you were a tech startup looking to try your hand at making an AI model, Jensen Huang was your man. As CEO of Nvidia, the world’s most valuable corporation, Huang helped the company become the undisputed leader of chips used both to train AI models and to ping a model when anyone uses it, called “inferencing.” A number of forces could change that in 2025. For one, behemoth competitors like Amazon, Broadcom, AMD, and others have been investing heavily in new chips, and there are early indications that these could compete closely with Nvidia’s—particularly for inference, where Nvidia’s lead is less solid.  A growing number of startups are also attacking Nvidia from a different angle. Rather than trying to marginally improve on Nvidia’s designs, startups like Groq are making riskier bets on entirely new chip architectures that, with enough time, promise to provide more efficient or effective training. In 2025 these experiments will still be in their early stages, but it’s possible that a standout competitor will change the assumption that top AI models rely exclusively on Nvidia chips. Underpinning this competition, the geopolitical chip war will continue. That war thus far has relied on two strategies. On one hand, the West seeks to limit exports to China of top chips and the technologies to make them. On the other, efforts like the US CHIPS Act aim to boost domestic production of semiconductors. Donald Trump may escalate those export controls and has promised massive tariffs on any goods imported from China. In 2025, such tariffs would put Taiwan—on which the US relies heavily because of the chip manufacturer TSMC—at the center of the trade wars. That’s because Taiwan has said it will help Chinese firms relocate to the island to help them avoid the proposed tariffs. That could draw further criticism from Trump, who has expressed frustration with US spending to defend Taiwan from China.  It’s unclear how these forces will play out, but it will only further incentivize chipmakers to reduce reliance on Taiwan, which is the entire purpose of the CHIPS Act. As spending from the bill begins to circulate, next year could bring the first evidence of whether it’s materially boosting domestic chip production.  — James O’Donnell hide by James O'Donnell , Will Douglas Heaven , & Melissa Heikkilä Share Share story on linkedin Share story on facebook Share story on email Popular The 8 worst technology failures of 2024 Antonio Regalado AI can now create a replica of your personality James O'Donnell AI means the end of internet search as we’ve known it Mat Honan 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2025 Amy Nordrum Deep Dive Artificial intelligence AI can now create a replica of your personality A two-hour interview is enough to accurately capture your values and preferences, according to new research from Stanford and Google DeepMind.\n",

      "As we venture into 2025, the artificial intelligence landscape is poised for transformative shifts that will reshape how we develop, deploy, and interact with AI systems. The emergence of more sophisticated AI capabilities brings both opportunities and challenges, demanding new approaches to system architecture, security, and cost management. From agentic AI systems taking center stage to the rising importance of efficient databases in GenAI applications, these predictions reflect the industry's evolution toward more autonomous, secure, and resource-conscious solutions.\n",
      "Let's explore the key trends that will define AI's trajectory in 2025.\n",
      "1. Agentic AI Systems Will Take the Lead\n",
      "AI Agents\n",
      "An Agent is nothing more than a prompt that instructs a language model to interact with specific tools.\n",
      "Well, an agent can reason, get into planning, call the required tools and take actions. An AI agent orchestrates the interaction between a model and external tools through carefully crafted prompts. These prompts instruct the model on when and how to use these tools.\n",
      "That is where your AI frameworks like LangChain come in handy by providing you the prompt templates that you can customise and reuse. These agents can break down complex problems into simpler components, enabling them to tackle intricate challenges efficiently. With the rise of AI technologies, businesses are increasingly adopting AI agents to enhance productivity and streamline operations.\n",
      "Let’s consider a simple example of an AI agent that answers user queries. The agent will take an input question, process it using the defined language model, and then call the appropriate tools to gather information. For instance, if a user asks, “What is the capital of France?”, the agent will recognise the query, search for the answer using a tool like Wikipedia, and return the response: “The capital of France is Paris.”\n",
      "This process illustrates how AI agents can efficiently handle user queries through structured reasoning and external tool integration.\n",
      "Know more about AI agents: https://lnkd.in/gd3bv7de\n",
      "The rise of agentic AI systems marks a pivotal shift in artificial intelligence development. These systems will evolve beyond simple task execution to demonstrate unprecedented levels of autonomy and decision-making capabilities. We'll see AI agents that can independently plan, execute complex workflows, and adapt to changing circumstances without constant human intervention. This advancement will revolutionize automation in various sectors, from business process management to scientific research. Organizations will increasingly deploy AI agents that can coordinate multiple tasks, manage resources, and even collaborate with other AI systems, creating a new paradigm in human-AI interaction and enterprise automation.\n",
      "Building agentic applications\n",
      "The future is all about building robust agentic applications. We will see many companies building multi-agent systems and applications to automate a lot of complex tasks. Traditionally, a single-agent architecture has been used to process inputs, make decisions, and produce outputs. However, as AI systems scale to handle more complex, multi-step tasks, researchers and developers are increasingly turning to multi-agent systems and advanced graph-based architectures. These innovations, supported by frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, enable more adaptable, scalable, and collaborative AI systems capable of performing sophisticated tasks.\n",
      "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous agents interacting within a network to achieve collaborative goals.A common challenge with agent frameworks is understanding what happens during agent iterations. This is where LangGraph Studio comes in. It provides a dedicated agent IDE that allows developers to visualize, interact with, and debug complex agent workflows.\n",

      "Here is a complete article about building multi-agent workflows: https://lnkd.in/gFfp7ury\n",
      "2. RAG Also Takes the Agentic Route\n",
      "Multi-agent RAG\n",
      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems will undergo a significant transformation by incorporating agentic capabilities. Instead of passive information retrieval and response generation, RAG systems will actively decide what information to fetch, how to validate it, and when to update their knowledge base. These enhanced systems will autonomously identify knowledge gaps, seek relevant information, and maintain data freshness. This evolution will result in more reliable, up-to-date, and context-aware AI applications that can better serve dynamic business environments and complex information needs.\n",
      "Multi-agent RAG systems represent a significant advancement in how AI applications can be constructed for enterprises. Unlike traditional RAG systems, which often rely on a single agent to handle requests, multi-agent RAG systems leverage multiple agents that can operate simultaneously to enhance efficiency and response quality. These systems break down tasks into smaller, manageable components, allowing for parallel processing. Each agent can specialize in a particular function, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses.\n",
      "This architecture not only improves speed but also enriches the user experience by providing more nuanced interactions, enhanced collaboration and scalability.Moreover, multi-agent RAG systems facilitate improved collaboration among agents, enabling them to share insights and findings dynamically. This collaborative environment allows for continuous learning and adaptation, which is crucial in rapidly changing contexts.\n",
      "As demands on AI systems grow, the scalability of multi-agent RAG becomes a vital asset; organizations can easily integrate additional agents to handle increased workloads or specialized tasks without overhauling the existing infrastructure. This flexibility ensures enterprises can maintain high performance and responsiveness, even as their operational needs evolve. Ultimately, the integration of multi-agent frameworks not only enhances the capabilities of RAG systems but also positions them as robust solutions for complex enterprise challenges.\n",
      "Know more about building multi-agent RAG systems from my medium article .\n",
      "3. AI Frameworks Climb up the AI Ladder\n",
      "The maturation of AI frameworks will accelerate, offering more sophisticated tools for developing and deploying AI applications. These frameworks will evolve to support complex agent-based architectures, advanced model optimization, and seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. We'll see the emergence of specialized frameworks focused on specific industry needs, offering pre-built components for common AI patterns. This advancement will democratize AI development, enabling organizations to build and deploy sophisticated AI solutions with less technical overhead and faster time-to-market.\n",
      "AI frameworks\n",
      "LlamaIndex excels in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, providing robust capabilities for knowledge graphs, document indexing, and structured data access, making it ideal for applications requiring sophisticated data integration.\n",
      "LangGraph specializes in sequential workflows and state management, perfect for applications needing structured pipelines and multi-step document analysis processes.\n",
      "CrewAI shines in team-based collaboration scenarios, enabling effective task delegation and role-based coordination among AI agents, particularly useful in projects requiring specialized agent roles working together.\n",
      "AutoGen focuses on autonomous agent interactions, facilitating complex reasoning and group problem-solving through multi-agent conversations, making it suitable for applications requiring emergent problem-solving capabilities.\n",
      "Haystack stands out in search-oriented applications, offering modular pipeline construction for question-answering systems and document processing.\n",
      "Each framework serves a distinct purpose: LlamaIndex handles data integration, LangGraph manages workflows, CrewAI coordinates team efforts, AutoGen enables autonomous interactions, and Haystack focuses on search functionality.\n",
      "The choice between these frameworks depends on specific project requirements: whether you need RAG capabilities, sequential workflows, team collaboration, autonomous agent interaction, or search-focused solutions. Understanding these distinctions helps developers choose the most appropriate framework for their AI applications.\n",
      "4. Securing AI Systems Becomes More Important Than Ever\n",
      "As AI systems become more autonomous and integral to critical operations, security will emerge as a paramount concern. Organizations will focus on developing comprehensive security frameworks specifically designed for AI systems, addressing vulnerabilities in model architecture, data pipelines, and deployment infrastructure. This includes protection against prompt injection attacks, model poisoning, and data leakage. Enhanced monitoring systems will be developed to track AI behavior, detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements.\n",
      "5. Small Language Models Gain More Attention\n",
      "The trend toward smaller, more efficient language models will gain significant momentum. These models will offer comparable performance to larger models in specific domains while requiring fewer computational resources. Organizations will increasingly adopt these specialized models for specific use cases, benefiting from lower operational costs and faster inference times. The development of distillation techniques and model compression methods will advance, making it possible to deploy powerful AI capabilities on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.\n",
      "LLMs vs SLMs\n",
      "Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) differ significantly in their architecture, processing capabilities, and resource requirements. SLMs feature a compact neural architecture that prioritizes efficiency and speed, making them ideal for specific, focused tasks. They process inputs quickly with lower computational demands, making them cost-effective and easier to deploy in resource-constrained environments.\n",
      "Examples like Mistral 7B and Microsoft's Phi-2 demonstrate how SLMs can deliver effective performance while maintaining a smaller footprint. On the other hand, LLMs employ a deep neural architecture capable of handling complex inputs and performing sophisticated analysis. They excel in tasks requiring broad knowledge and deep context understanding but demand significantly more computational resources and processing time.\n",
      "LLMs' intensive processing capabilities enable them to handle a wider range of tasks and generate more nuanced responses, but this comes at the cost of higher resource consumption and slower processing speeds. The choice between SLMs and LLMs often depends on the specific use case, available resources, and required performance levels. While SLMs offer speed and efficiency for specialized tasks, LLMs provide comprehensive capabilities for complex applications requiring deeper understanding and broader knowledge.\n",
      "Now the trend is to build a MOA (Mixture of Agents) out of specialized small models and this has proven to be more efficient than the individual large model. Also, like someone was saying the other day that small language models are the future for embedded system applications.\n",
      "6. LLM Cost Optimization Becomes Critical\n",
      "Cost optimization in LLM deployment will become a critical focus area as organizations seek to balance performance with operational expenses. Advanced techniques for model quantization, caching strategies, and efficient prompt engineering will emerge. Companies will invest in sophisticated monitoring tools to track model usage, optimize request patterns, and identify cost-saving opportunities. The industry will see new frameworks and best practices for managing LLM costs at scale, including intelligent routing systems that direct queries to the most cost-effective model based on the task requirements.\n",
      "LLM Cost Optimization\n",
      "LLM cost optimization involves multiple complementary strategies to reduce inference expenses while maintaining performance. Input optimization focuses on efficient prompt engineering and context pruning to minimize token usage, ensuring only essential information is processed.\n",
      "Model selection involves choosing right-sized models for specific tasks, preventing resource waste from oversized models while maintaining accuracy. Model optimization techniques like quantization and pruning reduce model size and computational requirements without significantly impacting performance.\n",
      "Distributed processing leverages distributed inference and load balancing to optimize resource utilization across multiple machines, improving throughput and cost efficiency. Caching strategies implement response and embedding caches to avoid redundant computations, storing frequently requested responses and pre-computed embeddings for quick retrieval.\n",
      "Output management implements token limits and stream processing to control response lengths and optimize data flow. System architecture considerations include batch processing to maximize throughput and request optimization to reduce unnecessary API calls. Together, these strategies form a comprehensive approach to LLM cost optimization, balancing performance requirements with resource efficiency. The key is implementing these strategies in combination, as each addresses different aspects of LLM deployment costs.\n",
      "Success requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of these strategies based on usage patterns, performance requirements, and cost metrics.\n",
      "Know more about such LLM cost optimization strategies and techniques in this blog .\n",
      "7. Databases' Role in Gen AI Applications Gains Even More Popularity\n",
      "The integration of specialized databases in GenAI applications will become increasingly crucial. Vector databases and hybrid storage solutions will evolve to better support AI workloads, offering improved performance and scalability. Organizations will adopt sophisticated data architectures that combine traditional databases with AI-optimized storage systems, enabling faster retrieval, better context management, and more efficient handling of diverse data types. This evolution will lead to more responsive and context-aware AI applications that can process and utilize information more effectively.\n",
      "Selecting vector database\n",
      "In my point of view, the vector database selection workflow for RAG follows a systematic evaluation process through four critical stages.\n",
      "The journey begins with Scale Requirements, where organizations must assess their data volume capacity needs, expected query performance demands, and horizontal scalability requirements to ensure the chosen database can handle both current and future workloads effectively. Next, the Deployment Model consideration examines whether cloud-native, on-premise, or hybrid solutions best align with organizational infrastructure, factoring in maintenance requirements and operational flexibility.\n",
      "The third stage focuses on Feature Requirements, evaluating essential capabilities such as CRUD operations support, multiple vector index types (like HNSW or IVF), robust metadata filtering, and real-time update capabilities. The final stage addresses Performance Metrics, where query latency, indexing speed, and resource utilization patterns are carefully analyzed to ensure optimal performance within budget constraints.\n",
      "Throughout this decision-making process, organizations must consider three overarching factors: budget limitations, team expertise with various technologies, and integration requirements with existing systems. This comprehensive evaluation framework helps organizations make informed decisions when selecting a vector database that not only meets their current RAG implementation needs but also provides scalability and flexibility for future growth.\n",
      "The workflow emphasizes the importance of balancing technical capabilities with practical considerations, ensuring a sustainable and efficient vector database solution that aligns with both technical requirements and organizational constraints.\n",
      "Well, I'll be a little biased here as I would like to choose SingleStore as my vector database.\n",
      "Why? Because SingleStore excels as a vector database by offering unified SQL and vector operations, horizontal scalability, and real-time analytics along with hybrid search capabilities. It meets all the required criteria through cloud-native and on-premise deployment flexibility, robust CRUD operations with HNSW indexing, high-performance vector search capabilities, and enterprise-grade features including metadata filtering and automatic load balancing. Also, it has a good integration with AI frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n",

Contact Sales Discuss your cloud needs with our sales team. Contact us It’s hard to imagine that we started the year off at a point where generative AI was still more fantasy than fact. We’ve gone from experimentation to seeing hundreds of gen AI agents come to life in the real world. While it’s evident the gen AI revolution is in full swing — it’s still a work in progress. According to a new National Research Group study, “ The ROI of Gen AI ,” commissioned by Google Cloud, roughly a third of all organizations are still evaluating or testing gen AI use cases. Gen AI is more than integrating a new technology tool, it’s a powerful business differentiator. As such, there are many considerations to take into account, from what models to choose and how to measure success to navigating cultural changes related to ways of working and organizational structure. Now, more than ever, executives are being challenged to build winning AI strategies that enable their organizations to capitalize on the current and future potential of gen AI. A big part of this process will be recognizing the value that gen AI brings to your specific industry and understanding how it connects back to the core value chain of your business. Throughout the year, my conversations have frequently involved questions around how to identify practical use cases that add genuine business value. While executives and business leaders understand the broader applications of gen AI, which I discussed earlier this year , they want more clarity about the primary use cases being pursued in their industry and the top areas where gen AI is already boosting bottom lines. To get answers, I asked our Google Cloud industry leaders about what’s happening now and next with gen AI across retail, healthcare, financial services, and media & entertainment. In these conversations, there were five trends that emerged: our customers are taking advantage of multimodal AI, building AI agents, using AI-powered search, building AI-powered customer experiences, and they’re working on strategies for deepfake defense. Hopefully, sharing some of these perspectives can help shed light on the use cases bringing immediate value in your industry and the outlook for longer-term transformation in the coming months and years. The ROI of gen AI Google Cloud surveyed more than 2,500 business and technology leaders to discover where and how they are seeing the biggest returns on their AI investments. One thing is clear: Those who aren't deploying AI today risk falling behind tomorrow. Read it now. Retail Though abundant, early gen AI retail experiments at the start of the year were often limited in value at scale and many never moved beyond the pilot stage. In the second half of the year, retailers are reshaping these initial approaches, focusing on the concrete ways gen AI can drive value for both consumers and associates. The result is a growing number of retail use cases that center on driving growth, efficiency, and optimization within the operational parts of retail business. Mark Steel, Google Cloud’s director of retail and consumer strategy, characterizes this shift as a move from use case to business use case, saying, “Instead of only thinking about AI strategy, retailers have shifted focus to answering the question of how AI can turbocharge their business strategies. This alignment with strategic objectives is helping to apply AI to the most important priorities within organizations more broadly instead of simply testing across every possible use case and area.” More specifically, in the near term, retailers are zeroing in on areas like customer service, marketing, and digital commerce, using gen AI search and agents to enhance existing human capability and skills. Customer service centers are deploying tools that are AI first; can automate call transcription, generate smart replies, and respond to common customer questions. In marketing functions, teams are integrating gen AI to help write briefs, brainstorm campaign concepts, and produce personalized brand content at greater scale. We also see these capabilities coming together in AI-powered customer experiences, powering personal shopping advisors, generating new product content, and creating engaging, human-like conversational interfaces to improve online shopping experiences. All together, Steel believes these current initiatives are laying the groundwork for longer-term transformation use cases that tap into powerful multimodal models like Gemini with long context capabilities to build increasingly sophisticated AI agents that can support the efficient running and operation of their business. One example of these agents includes personal AI stylists that can combine deep customer background knowledge with a retailer’s products, promotions, and pricing to offer personalized style recommendations across multiple visits — regardless of channel or touchpoint. “The retailers who have made the most progress to date are not only focused on technology challenges, but also what changes are needed to embrace this new opportunity,” Steel said. “AI has huge potential to fundamentally transform how retailers work, so leaders should be open to changing processes, org structures, and historical ways of working to drive maximum benefit.” Financial services As a historically data-rich, insight-poor industry, the financial services industry stands to gain huge benefits in the future from using gen AI to unlock value in areas like fraud detection, risk management, and customer service. However, there are many existing challenges that must be addressed around regulatory compliance, governance, and data privacy to realize this potential. As a result, we see most use cases in the industry currently focusing on cost savings and efficiency rather than new revenue generation. Most organizations have achieved early success by using gen AI to deliver productivity gains. This includes implementing AI agents and AI-powered search to drive faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries, accelerate incident response by detecting critical fraud alerts faster, and empower employees to work faster, smarter, and more effectively. Rather than trying to replace a function wholesale, we’re seeing financial services organizations dig into use cases that deliver more incremental productivity improvements and enable existing resources to do more. Zac Maufe, global head of regulated industries at Google Cloud, views this trend as a reaction to the ad hoc approaches utilized during the early rush to adopt and experiment with gen AI. Many organizations are realizing they will need to have a strong understanding of how gen AI can accelerate and integrate into day-to-day tasks to maximize its impact. For example, an investment banker doing market research needs to do more than summarize information from documents with gen AI, they need to generate summaries in a specific template to truly speed up their workflow. “What everybody’s waking up to is that gen AI is a different way of working, so how you develop this technology has to be done in a more holistic approach,” Maufe said. “Gen AI isn’t bolted on as an extra thing. To use it, you have to tailor it a bit to how people are working.” In the long term, Maufe believes gen AI will emerge as a key building block to develop products and services that can provide financial advice and guidance, tailored for the customer. As financial institutions have increasingly transitioned towards a self-service reality, they have struggled to achieve the same amount of sales and levels of personalization previously possible when serving customers in person. Here, gen AI shows great promise for transforming customer experiences, especially online, making it easier for customers to manage accounts and navigate more complex questions like planning for retirement or selecting a mortgage loan to purchase a property. Though exciting, Maufe notes that these transformational capabilities will take some time to build and navigate with regulatory bodies, saying, “There’s a lot of regulatory scrutiny around data privacy and explainability, and getting data into a format that's ready for use cases continues to be a challenge. Ultimately, driving revenue is more the next frontier. It’s not going to take decades, but it won’t happen overnight either.” Healthcare Faced with an increasingly challenging regulatory landscape, we have seen most healthcare organizations starting their gen AI journeys by tackling use cases that boost productivity and efficiency. Gen AI is ideal for assisting with routine tasks, such as appointment scheduling or processing patient intake forms, creating many opportunities to reduce the administrative workloads on clinicians. This trend is expected to grow. As Aashima Gupta, Google Cloud’s global director of healthcare industry solutions, points out, \"We expect a surge in healthcare providers and health plans adopting AI agents to assist with key administrative tasks, such as nurse handoffs, and generating easy-to-understand explanations and communications, ultimately freeing up staff for patient care and other higher-value activities.\" Among healthcare organizations, the top use cases delivering near-term value are those that accelerate clinical operations. For instance, gen AI is being used to streamline back-office tasks, including clinical documentation, member and provider communications, and claims processing. AI agents can provide 24/7 support to respond to coverage queries, eligibility questions, or claim statuses. We also see healthcare providers investing heavily in leveraging gen AI tools to generate more targeted, personalized marketing outreach, from straightforward explanations and visuals for medical jargon to coding terminology used in health insurance plans. Gupta views these initial improvements as the fundamental groundwork for greater AI transformation. Already, we see longer-term use cases taking shape that incorporate many different types of AI — not just gen AI. Some top examples include using AI to enhance access to healthcare, reimagine screening and early detection by AI-assisted image analysis in specialties like radiology and enable new innovations like AI health concierges that can offer personalized health recommendations, multilingual support, medication reminders, and care navigation advice. There’s also an increasing number of AI models emerging that simulate biological processes to aid in discovering new drugs or repurposing existing ones. According to Gupta, the ultimate vision of AI in healthcare is to empower individuals to take control of their own health, moving us beyond simply treating diseases to actively preventing them. AI can sift through massive datasets — patient records, clinical trials, genetic information, and more — to identify patterns and predict disease risk with unprecedented accuracy. This leads to earlier interventions, more effective treatments, and the development of new therapies targeted to an individual's specific needs. “We'll see a rise in the adoption of multimodal AI models to analyze data such as medical records, imaging data, and genomic information to draw insightful summaries, moving closer to the vision of personalized medicine. This convergence of data analysis and AI is key to unlocking a deeper understanding of individual health, paving the way for truly personalized healthcare,” Gupta said. Media & entertainment For years, the media and entertainment industry has described digital transformation as a shift from traditional to becoming “media-tech” companies. Now, we’re entering the next phase of that evolution — becoming “media-AI” companies. At the start of the year, we saw what one customer called a “demo-palooza” across the media and entertainment industry — individual teams experimenting with gen AI more organically without any formal, top-down approach. Today, Albert Lai, global strategic industries director for media & entertainment at Google Cloud, says this approach is giving way to strategies with well-defined prioritization, governance, and clear business outcomes linked to the responsible use of enterprise AI. “Many companies have been able to navigate the noise and complexity and progress from use cases to solutions, from ideation to production, and from experimentation to return-on-investment,” Lai said. “We now see use cases that span the entire media supply chain — content production, monetization, audience experience — and within the entire enterprise.” The top use cases in the media and entertainment industry currently focus on implementing point solutions to enhance enterprise productivity — with search and AI agents — and audience personalization. For example, we see companies incorporating gen AI to automate routine customer services tasks for subscriptions and billing, accelerate back-office processes and provide better access to enterprise-wide data, drive operational and cost efficiencies for marketing, and streamline software development workflows. Gen AI is also making it easier to deliver more personalized audience experiences through multimodal recommendations and search as well as assisting with specific content localization tasks, such as dubbing and generating captions, subtitles, and audio descriptions. In the longer term, media and entertainment organizations will likely move towards building more powerful gen AI solutions, capable of optimizing entire workflows. We’ve already seen a lot of early exploration across the full spectrum of content production tasks, from script analysis to modernizing media archive search to content understanding for moderation and monetization. Other emerging use cases include integrating gen AI into workflows to assist with storyboarding, post-production processes, and media rendering. “Gen AI isn’t about replacing people in media and entertainment – it’s about using it responsibly to augment creative teams and to improve the viewer experience while helping to save costs and time and to grow revenue,” Lai said. Finding the right AI use cases for your business Overall, the last several months have been eye-opening, revealing new lessons and takeaways about the execution of gen AI. In the year ahead, I anticipate that we’ll start to see real differentiation from organizations that are able to launch AI strategies that make the most of their investments. Much of that work will be around understanding where the biggest opportunities are in your industry and prioritizing the right use cases to make an impact. But the rise of generative AI also brings new challenges. As AI becomes more sophisticated, so too do the methods of malicious actors. Deepfakes, AI-generated synthetic media that can convincingly replace someone's likeness or voice, pose a growing threat to individuals and organizations alike. To combat this, organizations must prioritize \"deepfake defense\" as a key component of their AI strategy. This involves investing in technologies and strategies to detect and mitigate the spread of deepfakes, protecting their brand reputation and fostering trust in an increasingly digital world. At Google Cloud, we are committed to sharing our decades of experience with pioneering AI innovation and helping organizations navigate through their toughest challenges. In particular, we are developing clear guidance and frameworks on how leaders can approach and develop robust AI strategies within their organization. For instance, we use a simple prioritization matrix to help us plot out potential use cases, comparing their expected value generation against their estimated actionability and feasibility, to help customers assess their capabilities and develop their AI roadmaps. Generative AI has quickly moved beyond being a novel concept and is now a dynamic tool for achieving business objectives and transforming industries. Looking ahead to 2025, businesses must identify their core value drivers and explore how generative AI can reimagine processes and rebuild experiences to fully realize the return on AI investments.
